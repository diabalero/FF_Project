            <h2>What is Next Level Fantasy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Next Level Fantasy is a new kind of Fantast Football game. We've added features we love about types of games to fantasy football to make the game
                    more interactive, more personal, and more strategic. We've taken Fantasy Football to...I won't say it. Here are some features we've added, all of 
                    which are optional when you set up your league.

                        <li>Upgrade your QB roster spot from 4 points per passing td, to 6 points.

                <li> <a href='link to rules'>Apply boosters to your roster</a> for point modifyers that highlight your teams strengths or cover its weekness. For Example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The RBBC Booster</b>: Own 2 running backs from the same team? Use this booster to play them both!</li>
                        <li><b>The Weekly Average Booster</b>: Is your stud on bye? Use this booster to take his weekly average instead of playing the waiver wire!</li>
                        <li><b>The Slinger</b>: Have a pass happy, but turnover prone QB? Use this and he will only score positive points! </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                </p>
